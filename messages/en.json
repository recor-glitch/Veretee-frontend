    "content": "Companies of all sizes across the EcoVadis Network, particularly those with multiple ratings, are making measurable progress on a broad spectrum of sustainability challenges. These insights and more are found in the eighth edition of the Business Sustainability Index, published today by business sustainability ratings provider EcoVadis. This edition of the Index explores the trends behind the 125,000+ supplier sustainability ratings (~38,000 in 2023 alone) EcoVadis has delivered to 1,200 leading procurement teams from 2019 through 2023. It looks at how these suppliers, spanning all global regions and major industries, are performing on four core assessment themes: Environment, Labor & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. Through data-driven analysis, it highlights the state of where global value chains stand on sustainability nearly halfway into a pivotal decade for climate and social action. The score trends give a view into how large purchasing organizations are leveraging ratings in their supply chains to reduce risk, build resilience, prepare for compliance with ESG reporting and due diligence laws, and unlock the value needed to thrive today and into the future. It also reflects how suppliers are also reducing operational risks, enhancing efficiency, saving costs, collecting better data and enhancing their relationships with business partners."
